    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tonkotsu is a type of ramen noodles, originated in Fukuoka, Japan. 
        Tonkotsu means “pig bone” so you can guess what’s the base of the ramen. 
        Tonkotsu is known for its own special rich, creamy white broth that is packed with flavors.
        Dis here soup is BOMBB.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds pig trotters, split lengthwise or cut crosswise into 1-inch disks (ask your butcher to do this for you)</li>
        <li>2 pounds chicken backs and carcasses, skin and excess fat removed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, skin on, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>12 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>One 3-inch knob ginger, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 whole leeks, washed and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 dozen scallions, white parts only (reserve greens and light green parts for garnishing finished soup)</li>
        <li>6 ounces whole mushrooms or mushroom scraps</li>
        <li>1 pound slab pork fat back</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place pork fat in a medium pot with enough water to cover pork. 
            Bring it to boil over medium high then cook pork belly 5 to 7 minutes or until fully cooked. 
            Cut pork fat into small chunks and place in a blender. 
            Add chicken stock and blend high speed until smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Pour pork fat and chicken stock mixture back to now-empty-pot 
            (rinse pot quickly then use) then add in dashi stock and unsweetened soy milk. 
            Stir and bring it to simmer over medium heat.
            Also, bring another pot of water to boil to cook noodles and toppings.
         </li>

            Meanwhile, let’s prepare ramen toppings. 
            Chop green onion. Slice black fungus into long thin strips. 
            Prepare chashu by searing on a dry pan over high heat, torch or high broil for 3 to 5 minutes. 
         </li>
         <li>
            When water is boiling, blanch bean sprouts for 1 minute then remove from water. 
            Drain well and set aside. Next, blanch black fungus for 1 minutes then remove from water. 
            Drain well and set aside. Finally, start cooking noodles. 
            Fresh or frozen one will take only 2 minutes. Instant ramen noodles will take 3 to 4 minutes. 
         </li>
         <li>
            While noodles are cooking, add tsuyu or chashu tare in a serving bowl. 
            Carefully, pour 1 1/2 cup of broth we made earlier. Mix well.
            Drain cooked noodles well and add to bowl. Stir noodles to coat evenly with broth and arrange. 
            Arrange toppings on top of noodles – beansprouts, black fungus, green onions, chashu and ramen egg.
            Lastly, to your taste, grate in a clove of garlic. 
            This sharp spicy garlic will perfectly balance this thick rich broth. Enjoy!
